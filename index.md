title: HDSI Public Service Data Science Fellowship

## Public Service Data Science
**The HDSI (Harvard Data Science Initiative) Public Service Data Science Graduate Fellowship** supports Master’s students in Harvard’s data science programs (Biomedical Informatics, Health Data Science, Data Science) who want to explore career paths at not-for-profit and public sector organizations through a summer internship.

The fellowship includes a $10,000 stipend to support an unpaid summer 2020 internship at a not-for-profit or public sector organization that either (a) applies data science to solve social challenges, or (b) advocates for responsible data science.  The stipend is intended to support living expenses during the summer and may not be used for tuition.

Fellows are also expected to promote public service data science at Harvard, which will include documenting their experience in the fellowship through a blog post or short report to the HDSI; and may include community-building activities such as:

- Facilitating a public service data science reading group
- Participating on panels and in discussions/talks
- Serving as a resource to other students interested in public service and data science
